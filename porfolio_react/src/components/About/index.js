                        I am a Web developer with a background in hospitality and communication. I have a proven ability to focus on the
                customer experience while enhancing a brand message. I excel in fast paced, team oriented
                environments that require hard work, attention to detail, and the ability to adapt. My objective
                is to join an entrepreneurial web development team with a focus on mobile-first design and
                building a better web-experience.
